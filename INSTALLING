Requires a 32-bit Python interpreter. Tested with Python 2.7. Windows Only.

Furthermore, requires the following Python libraries:
- pydbg
- pydasm

Precompiled binaries for pydbg and pydasm can be downloaded here: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pydbg

I haven't read the ToS of the game as I don't play it, but I'm pretty sure 
using something like this is a BANNABLE  OFFENSE, so use at your own risk!

If you want a stand-alone executable, try PyInstaller: http://www.pyinstaller.org/

To change which items cause an alert, edit NotifyItems.py and add new items to the list _notifyItems: _notifyItems.append('Correct Item Name')
