## ItemAlertPoE — Item Alerter for Path of Exile

**ItemAlertPoE** tracks all item drops in the game [Path of Exile](http://www.pathofexile.com/) and announces them.  
For each item that the user wants to track, ItemAlertPoE plays a notification sound and outputs the item in a console window.

Items to be tracked can be added in NotifyItems.py, see the **INSTALLING file** for more information.

Currently, only item names are being tracked. Item quality, stats etc. should follow soon (tm).

## Notes

It has been brought to my attention that under certain circumstances, my way of processing the packet may be wrong.  
I would strongly advise against using this program on a hardcore character, as crashes may occur.

**This program may be cause for a permanent ban from the game.**  
**I'm in no way responsible for any actions taken against the user, the user's account or characters.**
