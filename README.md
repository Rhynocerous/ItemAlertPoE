## ItemAlertPoE — Item Alerter for Path of Exile

**ItemAlertPoE** tracks all item drops in the game [Path of Exile](http://www.pathofexile.com/) and announces them.
For each item that the user wants to track, **ItemAlertPoE** plays a notification sound and outputs the
item in a console window.

Items to be tracked can be added in NotifyItems.py, see the INSTALLING file for more information.

Currently, only item names are being tracked. Item quality, stats etc. should follow soon (tm).
