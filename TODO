* Allow graceful termination (right now, the debugee will hang and crash when the debugger is detached)
(* or: Write hooks instead of attaching a debugger)
* Reverse more of the item parsing process (quality, status {unidentified, normal}, gem slots, mods, ..)
* Add item filters
* Fix bug where the itemId is 4 bytes further into the packet, thanks to "stimmedcow - blizzhackers.cc" for pointing this out
